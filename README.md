## Usage

### Syntax Highlighting

We are providing syntax highlighting as it is from a fork of vuejs/vuejs-syntax-highlight. You need not to configure it. It is already configured for you.

### Snippets

We provide following set of snippets. Have  a look at them. They may be increased or decreased as per the version of VueJS. Just put those letters and press <key>tab</key>

* **v**:
This is a simple trigger which may be used like this:

	var demo = new Vue({
		data [v]Press tab here to transform in something like this:
		data: {
			Your text here|
		}
	})

* **vue**:
This ones is great if you have a brand new js file and you want to trigger the whole thing at ones.

	var vm = new Vue({
		el: "#replace"
	})

* **vue-config**:
This snippet is for expanding config of the whole VueJS. It looks like this:

	{
	  debug: true,

	  strict: false,

	  prefix: 'v-',

	  delimiters: ['{{', '}}']},

	  silent: false,

	  interpolate: true,

	  async: true,

	  proto: true
	}

* **vue-dir**:
Create a custom directive very easily using this snippet. You custom directive will look like this.

	Vue.directive('my-directive', {
	  bind: function () {

	  },
	  update: function (newValue, oldValue) {

	  },
	  unbind: function () {

	  }
	})

* **vue-filter**:
Create a custom filter using this snippet.

	Vue.filter('my-filter', function (value) {
	  //content
	})

* **vue-cdn**:
Get a cdn snippet which would expand to something like this:
	
	<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/0.12.14/vue.min.js"></script>


And yeah __There are even more that are coming soon__.
